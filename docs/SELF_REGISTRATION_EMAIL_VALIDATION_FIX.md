# Self-Registration Email Validation Fix - August 26, 2025

## Problem Statement
Users were able to register with email addresses that were already registered in the `auth.users` table. This caused issues where:
- Users would get a success notification but no email would be sent
- The registration would appear to succeed but the user couldn't actually complete the process
- This only affected self-registration (client accounts), not admin or staff registration

## Root Cause Analysis
- The registration form had no validation to check if an email already existed in `auth.users`
- Supabase's `auth.signUp()` would fail silently or provide unclear error messages
- No real-time feedback to users about email availability

## Solution Implemented

### Database Changes
**Migration Applied**: `check_email_exists`
- Created `public.check_email_exists(p_email text)` function to check if email exists in `auth.users`
- Created `public.get_user_status_by_email(p_email text)` function to get detailed user status
- Both functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` to access `auth.users` table
- Granted `EXECUTE` permission to authenticated users

### Frontend Changes
**File Modified**: `src/pages/Register.tsx`

#### Real-time Email Validation
- Added email validation state: `emailError` and `isCheckingEmail`
- Implemented debounced email validation (500ms delay)
- Added real-time email format validation
- Added visual feedback with loading spinner and error messages

#### Form Validation Updates
- Added email validation check before form submission
- Enhanced error handling with specific messages for existing emails
- Added visual indicators (red border) for invalid emails
- Prevented form submission when email validation fails

#### Registration Flow Updates
- Added email existence check before attempting registration
- Clear error messages directing users to login or password reset
- Maintained existing functionality for staff and admin registration

## Key Features

### Real-time Validation
- Email format validation using regex
- Debounced API calls to prevent excessive requests
- Visual feedback with loading states and error messages
- Only validates for client accounts (self-registration)

### Error Handling
- Specific error messages for existing emails
- Guidance to users about login or password reset options
- Graceful handling of API errors
- Form submission prevention when validation fails

### Security
- Functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` for proper access control
- Only authenticated users can execute the functions
- No exposure of sensitive user data in error messages

## Testing Results

### Database Functions
✅ `check_email_exists()` returns correct boolean values  
✅ `get_user_status_by_email()` returns proper JSON structure  
✅ Functions handle non-existent emails correctly  
✅ Proper permissions granted to authenticated users  

### Frontend Validation
✅ Real-time email format validation works  
✅ Debounced validation prevents excessive API calls  
✅ Visual feedback shows loading and error states  
✅ Form submission blocked when email validation fails  
✅ Clear error messages guide users appropriately  

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Users could enter existing emails without warning
- Registration appeared to succeed but failed silently
- No clear guidance on what went wrong
- Confusing experience with no email received

### After
- Real-time feedback on email availability
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Visual indicators for validation status
- Prevention of failed registration attempts

## Scope Compliance
- ✅ Only affects self-registration (client accounts)
- ✅ No changes to admin or staff registration flows
- ✅ Maintains existing functionality for all other features
- ✅ Follows project patterns and conventions
