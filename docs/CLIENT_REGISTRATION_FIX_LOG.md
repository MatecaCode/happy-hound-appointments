# Client Registration Fix - August 24, 2025

## Problem Statement
Self-registration flow was not properly populating the `public.clients` table when users clicked "Registrar". Users could register and confirm email, but client records were incomplete or missing, causing issues with the client management system.

## Root Cause Analysis
- ✅ `handle_unified_registration()` trigger was firing correctly on user signup
- ✅ `user_roles` table was being populated with 'client' role  
- ❌ `clients` table INSERT was missing crucial fields:
  - `admin_created` (not set, defaulting to NULL)
  - `claimed_at` (not set, leaving NULL)
- ❌ Existing self-registered clients had incomplete records

## Solution Implemented

### Database Changes
**Migration Applied**: `fix_client_registration_claimed_at`
- Updated `public.handle_unified_registration()` trigger function
- Added `admin_created = false` for self-registered clients
- Added `claimed_at = now() at time zone 'America/Sao_Paulo'` for immediate claim
- Fixed existing client records with missing data

### Key Code Changes
```sql
-- OLD (incomplete):
INSERT INTO clients (user_id, name, email)
VALUES (NEW.id, user_name, NEW.email)

-- NEW (complete):
INSERT INTO clients (
  user_id, name, email, admin_created, claimed_at
) VALUES (
  new.id, user_name, new.email, 
  false,  -- self-registered, not admin-created
  (now() at time zone 'America/Sao_Paulo')  -- immediately claimed
)
```

## Flow Verification
**Self-Registration Process Now:**
1. User clicks "Registrar" → `auth.users` record created
2. `handle_unified_registration()` trigger fires immediately  
3. `clients` table populated with complete data:
   - ✅ `user_id` (from auth.users)
   - ✅ `name` (from form data)
   - ✅ `email` (from auth.users) 
   - ✅ `admin_created = false` (self-registered)
   - ✅ `claimed_at = now()` (immediately claimed)
4. `user_roles` table gets 'client' role
5. User confirms email → can log in with complete profile

## Admin Flow Preserved
- ✅ Admin-created clients still use `admin_created = true`, `user_id = NULL` until claim
- ✅ Admin booking guardrails maintained: `_client_id` only for admin-created+unclaimed
- ✅ Self-registered clients use `_client_user_id` path (admin_created=false)
- ✅ No conflicts between admin and self-registration flows

## Data Cleanup
- Updated 5 existing self-registered clients with proper `admin_created=false` and `claimed_at` 
- Created missing client record for test user `b2742024@ben.edu`
- All client records now complete and consistent

## Testing Results
✅ **BEFORE**: Client registration created incomplete records, missing admin_created/claimed_at  
✅ **AFTER**: Client registration immediately creates complete client records  
✅ **Verification**: All self-registered clients now have complete data  
✅ **Admin flows**: Unaffected, working as designed  

## Files Modified
- Database: `public.handle_unified_registration()` function
- Migration: Applied via `mcp_supabase_apply_migration`
- Data: Updated existing incomplete client records

## Timezone Compliance  
All timestamps use `America/Sao_Paulo` timezone as per project standards.

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Self-registration client population now works immediately upon clicking "Registrar"
