# [LOG_UPDATE] - Client Account Claim Flow Implementation

**Date:** January 20, 2025  
**Area:** Auth/Clients/Claim Flow  
**Developer:** Cursor AI  

## Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive "claim account" flow that allows admin-created clients to claim their accounts via email invitations, linking existing client data to new auth users securely.

## Schema Changes

### Database Migrations Applied:
1. **add_client_claim_account_columns**
   - Added `admin_created boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false` to clients table
   - Added `created_by uuid NULL` (FK → auth.users.id ON DELETE SET NULL) to clients table
   - Created indexes: `idx_clients_admin_created`, `idx_clients_user_id`, `idx_clients_email_admin_created`

2. **create_client_linking_trigger**
   - Created `link_client_on_auth_signup()` function (SECURITY DEFINER)
   - Automatically links admin-created clients to new auth users on signup
   - Handles single match (links), multiple matches (logs conflict), no matches (ignores)
   - Logs all actions in admin_actions table
   - Created trigger `trigger_link_client_on_auth_signup` on auth.users AFTER INSERT

3. **create_manual_client_linking_rpc**
   - Created `link_client_to_auth(_email text, _auth_user_id uuid)` RPC function
   - Provides manual linking capability with same safety guardrails
   - Returns JSON status with success/error details
   - Logs manual linking actions

## Frontend Implementation

### AdminClients.tsx Updates:
- Updated Client interface to include `admin_created` and `created_by` fields
- Added claim status badges: "Aguarda Reivindicação" (red), "Conta Vinculada" (green)
- Implemented `handleSendClaimEmail()` using Supabase Auth Admin API
- Implemented `handleBulkSendClaimEmails()` for batch operations
- Added "Send Claim Email" button (only visible for eligible clients)
- Added "Bulk Send" button in toolbar with count of eligible clients
- Updated client creation to set `admin_created: true` and `created_by: user.id`

### New Claim Page (src/pages/Claim.tsx):
- Landing page for email invitation links (redirect: `/claim`)
- Automatically detects claim status on page load
- Uses RPC function for manual linking if automatic trigger failed
- Shows success/error states with appropriate user messaging
- Guides users to continue to main app after successful claim

### Routing:
- Added `/claim` route to App.tsx
- Import added for Claim component

## Security & Guardrails

### Email Invitation Flow:
- Uses Supabase `auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail()` with redirect to `/claim`
- Only available for clients where `admin_created = true AND user_id IS NULL`
- All invite actions logged in admin_actions table with full audit trail

### Linking Logic Safety:
- **Exact match required:** `lower(email) = lower(auth_email)`
- **Admin-created only:** `admin_created = true`
- **Unclaimed only:** `user_id IS NULL`
- **Single match rule:** Multiple matches are logged but NOT linked (requires manual resolution)
- **Automatic via trigger:** On auth user INSERT
- **Manual via RPC:** For backfill/troubleshooting operations

### Booking Payload Branching (Maintained):
- **Claimed clients:** Use `_client_user_id` (existing user-linked clients)
- **Admin-created unclaimed:** Use `_client_id` (admin-created clients without user)
- **Invalid states:** Block with clear error messages

## Testing Results

### Database Functions:
✅ Trigger properly installed on auth.users table  
✅ RPC function validates inputs and returns appropriate errors  
✅ Schema migrations applied successfully with proper indexes  
✅ Test client creation with admin_created flag works correctly  

### UI Components:
✅ AdminClients shows correct claim status badges  
✅ Claim buttons only appear for eligible clients  
✅ Bulk send button shows accurate count of eligible clients  
✅ Claim page renders and handles different states properly  

### Integration Points:
✅ Email invitation API calls work through Supabase Auth Admin  
✅ Claim page integrates with RPC for manual linking  
✅ All admin actions properly logged for audit trail  

## Configuration Notes

### Email Template:
- HTML template already configured in Supabase for invite emails
- Uses `{{ .ActionURL }}` with `&redirect_to=https://app.vettale.shop/claim`
- Branded email design per project requirements

### Environment Variables:
- Uses existing Supabase configuration
- No additional environment variables required

## Deployment Checklist
- [✅] Database migrations applied
- [✅] Trigger and RPC functions deployed
- [✅] Frontend components updated

## Non-Negotiables Maintained
- ✅ **Staff profiles terminology:** All references use `staff_profile_id`
